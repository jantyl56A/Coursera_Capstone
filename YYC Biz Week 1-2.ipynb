    "## 1. Introduction:\n",
    "Well-known for natural beauty of the close-by Rocky Mountains, the City of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, has also gone through transformation in terms of availability of beer in the last three decades. Historically, distribution and access to alcohol was limited and controlled by the government. In 1993, there were only 202 retail locations, so-called Alberta Liquor Control Board (ALCB) Liquor Stores in the entire province (Wikipedia) and many restaurants did not sell alcohol on Sundays. In 1993, following a provincial election, all ALCB liquor stores were quickly privatized and the industry experienced a major boom. The decision was controversial, due to its impact on both employment and alcohol availability. It is also true that, \"In recent years disorderly conduct at and near licensed establishments was identified as a growing problem, particularly in the major cities. The province's economic boom and the resulting affluence of its youth were identified as the root cause of the increase in binge drinking\" (Wikipedia).The objective of this Capstone Project is to explore Calgary communities to establish how available beer is in Calgary today, both in retail venues and in restaurants. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Capstone Project's objective, then, is to collect information available from public sources to collect information and perform an analysis of Calgary communities, identifying establishents holding Alcohol Beverage Sales License and Liquor Stores. This informatio will be pre-processed and subjected to clustering to identify and rank Calgary regions in terms of beer availability. This exercise does not intend to explore and rank quality of the beverages sold or served, as these preferences are highly subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected, that the downtown and University of Calgary areas are best-served in this respect, while bedroom communities in the suburbs are not. In addition, the results should provide the newcomer to Calgary with one bit of information that may be relevant when making the decision as to which community suits their needs best.\n",

    "Following review of the data and some pre-processing, the relevant data has been mapped out to obtain an overall perspective on draft beer availability in the City. While this overall review indicates the status quo, additional detail has been obtained through clustering. \n",

Communities with the largest and lowest number of locations have been identified and graphed and mapped out, then, for the purposes clustering, the data has been clened and simplified. Eight clusters has been determined as being the optimum and the method used was k-means.\n"

In the west, the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks have glaciers in the Columbia Icefields.

    "The objective of this project is to illustrate the impact on the society of changing the rules and provide basic information on the current situation. As mentioned previously, until 1994, there were only 202 liquor stores in the entire province, and, in Calgary, the bar community was represented primarily by \"Electric Avenue\", four blocks of two dozens of bars on 11 Ave, S.W.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers show clearly that, even though the concept of liquor stores has been kept, deregulation of the industry has led to a boom - there are over 350 liquor stores in Calgary and the number of beer-serving places has gone well over 1,500. \n"

    "In this Capstone project k-means clustering was used to divide the City of Calgary into 8 clusters. The clusters vary from 103 (cluster 7) to 756 (cluster 1) venues.\n",

    "The findings support the assumption that downtown houses the largest number of beer-serving establishments, while the bedroom communities in suburbs have the lowest number of the venues.\n",
